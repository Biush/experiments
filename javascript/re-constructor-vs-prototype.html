Hi Steve,

First, thank you for the tutorial/hints in javascript/constructor-vs-prototype.html

I did want to point out one thing, though. You basically spend lines 215 to 255 
demonstrating why defining ```this.company``` within the ```Employee``` constructor 
is "the WRONG way to do it," however it seems like you're missing the broader 
context for that technique. 

So...
-->

<!--
  tl;dr: "Classes" in JavaScript consist of a constructor function and prototype
  object that point to each other.
-->

  <script>

/*
 * So, you seem to imply that ```company``` should be a "class" variable, 
 * with a single value shared by all instances of ```Employee```. In that 
 * case, yes, declaring ```Employee.prototype.company``` after the definition 
 * for ```Employee``` is one way to make that happen. 

 * On the other hand, what about the variables ```firstName``` and ```lastName```? 
 * In the example you add these variables to each of the ```Employee``` objects 
 * after they have been instantiated, which indicates that an instance of 
 * ```Employee``` may or may NOT have a ```firstName``` or ```lastName```. Yet, 
 * if you wanted to ensure that every ```Employee``` had a ```firstName``` and 
 * ```lastName```, as well as indicate that the value of these variables is 
 * independent from one instance to another (i.e. "instance" variables), then using 
 * ```this``` to define these vars within the ```Employee``` constructor is the 
 * optimal technique:
 */
    var Employee = function( firstName, lastName )
    {
        this.firstName = firstName || "First Name";
        this.lastName = lastName || "Last Name";
    }
	
/*
 * Also, getting back to ```Employee.prototype.company```, you can use it within 
 * the constructor function and still achieve a "class" level variable, the value 
 * of which is shared by all instances, as in:
 */
	
    var Employee = function( firstName, lastName )
    {
        Employee.prototype.company = "EA";	// overwrites prototype 'company' 
											// each time constructor is called
        this.firstName = firstName || "First Name";
        this.lastName = lastName || "Last Name";
    }
	
/* 
 * If you change ```Employee.prototype.company``` after the object has been created, 
 * that object's ```company``` will change as well. Unless you specifically assign 
 * a value to ```dude.company``` after you instantiate a new ```Employee``` (in this 
 * case ```dude```), that object's ```company``` will be referenced up the prototype 
 * chain. So, using the above constructor you can:
 */
    var steve = new Employee("Steve", "Kwan");
    var andrew = new Employee("Andrew", "Wilson");
    console.log( steve.firstName +"\n"+ steve.lastName +"\n"+ steve.company );
    console.log( andrew.firstName +"\n"+ andrew.lastName +"\n"+ andrew.company );

    Employee.prototype.company = "Electronic Arts";
    console.log( steve.firstName +"\n"+ steve.lastName +"\n"+ steve.company );
    console.log( andrew.firstName +"\n"+ andrew.lastName +"\n"+ andrew.company );
	console.log( "\n" );


  // Let's add some more default properties to Employee.  This is the RIGHT way
  // to do it.  It's also our first exposure to prototype, a very important
  // concept in JavaScript OOP.
  Employee.prototype.division = "Sports";
  Employee.prototype.country  = "Canada";

  // Great!  Now let's create a helper function that prints out an employee.
  Employee.prototype.print = function()
  {
    var output =
      this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName + ', ' + // First the name
      this.division + ' division, ' +               // Then division
      this.company + ' ' + this.country + '.';       // Then company/location
    console.log(output);
  };

  // Now let's create a new object based off of our "class"...
  var steve = new Employee();

  // Looking good so far.  Now let's fill in my name:
  steve.firstName = "Steve";
  steve.lastName  = "Kwan";

  console.log("My employee object...");
  steve.print();
  console.log(''); // This is just for console display formatting
  // Output:
  // My employee object...
  // Steve Kwan, Sports division, EA Canada.

  // So far so good!  Now let's create another employee: my boss!
  var andrew       = new Employee();
  andrew.firstName = "Andrew";
  andrew.lastName  = "Wilson";

  // Only thing is, Andrew works in California.
  andrew.country = "USA";

  // Let's see what we've got!
  console.log("Steve and Andrew...");
  steve.print();
  andrew.print();
  console.log('');
  // Output:
  // Steve and Andrew...
  // Steve Kwan, Sports division, EA Canada.
  // Andrew Wilson, Sports division, EA USA.

  // Looking good so far!

  // ...Oops.  I realize I made a typo.  Our division isn't called "Sports"...
  // it's actually "EA SPORTS".  Common mistake:
  // http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcw_G0oK6Ns

  // While we're at it, let's also rename the company from EA to the proper
  // name, "Electronic Arts".

  // So let's change the default in our class definition and try again:
  Employee.company            = "Electronic Arts";
  Employee.prototype.division = "EA SPORTS"; // It's in the game!

  // And let's make sure our change took effect...
  console.log("After changing company and division...");
  steve.print();
  andrew.print();
  console.log('');
  // Output:
  // After changing company and division...
  // Steve Kwan, EA SPORTS division, EA Canada.
  // Andrew Wilson, EA SPORTS division, EA USA.

  delete Employee.company;                        // Remove from constructor
  Employee.prototype.company = "Electronic Arts"; // Put it in the right place
	  
  /* The following output now shows the correct company label */
  console.log( "Now declaring 'company' back within the constructor function: " );

  // So let's check our changes...
  console.log("Checking our fix...");
  steve.print();
  andrew.print();
  console.log('');
  // Output:
  // Checking our fix...
  //! Steve Kwan, EA SPORTS division, Electronic Arts Canada. 
  //! Andrew Wilson, EA SPORTS division, Electronic Arts USA.

/* 
 * The only problem here is that if a new object is created 
 * ```Employee.prototype.company``` will be reset to EA.  Here's a way 
 * to deal with that:
 */

    var Employee = function( firstName, lastName )
    {
        Employee.prototype.company = Employee.prototype.company || "EA";
        this.firstName = firstName || "First Name";
        this.lastName = lastName || "Last Name";
    }
    Employee.prototype.company = "Electronic Arts";

    var revlin = new Employee("Revlin", "John");
    revlin.company = "N/A"; // change revlin's employer

    console.log( revlin.firstName +"\n"+ revlin.lastName +"\n"+ revlin.company );
    console.log( steve.firstName +"\n"+ steve.lastName +"\n"+ steve.company );
    console.log( andrew.firstName +"\n"+ andrew.lastName +"\n"+ andrew.company );
	  
/* 
 * Additionally, a neat way to add some level of encapsulation to these variables 
 * would be to use ES5's property descriptor object, including getters and setters. 
 * Just wanted to point that out to you. Again, thank you for the short tutorial, 
 * which I'm currently using to wrap my brain around JavaScript "classes"
 * 
 * Dream, play & have fun,
 * Rev
