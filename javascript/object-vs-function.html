  An example to demonstrate the relationship between JavaScript's top-level
  Function and Object objects.

  For anyone seriously interested in JavaScript's object model, I highly
  recommend reading:
  http://vijayan.ca/blog/2012/02/21/javascript-type-model/

  In particular, this diagram from the article demonstrates the weird and
  complex relationships between Function and Object:
  http://vijayan.ca/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/javascript-object-function-and-array-relationship.png

  It's by far the best article I've encountered on the subject.  Be prepared for
  a bit of mind-bending, though.

  Here's another great one that should englighten about how constructor and
  prototype behave:

  Hope this helps!

  console.log("Function:");
  console.log(Function);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: function Function() { [native code] }
  // Reason:  The Function object is the constructor for all functions, and
  //          all constructors are functions.  Therefore Function is a function.

  console.log("Function.prototype:");
  console.log(Function.prototype);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: function Empty() {}
  // Reason:  Function's prototype reference contains all properties inherent
  //          to any JavaScript function.  In particular, it includes the
  //          apply() and call() functions.
  //
  //          I am not 100% sure why the prototype here needs to be a Function
  //          and cannot just be an Object, as I don't understand why the
  //          prototype would ever need to be directly invoked.
  //
  //          Also, it's worth noting that JavaScript does NOT provide direct
  //          access to the prototype property when you're dealing with instance
  //          objects.  However, you are allowed to access it as a direct
  //          property of the constructor.
  //
  //          A lot of browsers let you access prototype via way of the
  //          __proto__ property, but this is nonstandard and not officially
  //          part of JavaScript.

  console.log("Function.constructor:");
  console.log(Function.constructor);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: function Function() { [native code] }
  // Reason:  The constructor reference is what gets invoked when you declare
  //          new Function(), and thus it is a pointer back to Function
  //          itself...which we already learned was a Function.

  console.log("Function.prototype.constructor:");
  console.log(Function.prototype.constructor);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: function Function() { [native code] }
  // Reason:  The prototype.constructor chain is always used to fetch an
  //          object's original constructor method...in other words, the
  //          function that gets called when you invoke new WhateverObject().
  //
  //          In this case, that would be the function that gets called when
  //          you invoke new Function()...which as we already discussed, is
  //          Function itself.

  console.log("Object:");
  console.log(Object);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: function Object() { [native code] }
  // Reason:  The top-level Object is a function?  Craziness!!!
  //
  //          ...Actually, this makes sense once you understand how the new
  //          keyword works.  Every "class" (and I use the term loosely because
  //          JavaScript has no classes) is actually composed of TWO objects:
  //
  //          #1: A function which acts as the constructor method, and
  //          #2: An object which contains all members for that "class."
  //
  //          So #1 corresponds to the constructor property that all objects
  //          contain, and #2 corresponds to the prototype property.
  //
  //          The Object object is actually the constructor for all new objects,
  //          which is why the syntax new Object() works.  Internally, it
  //          contains a reference to its prototype.  This is why Object
  //          is a function...it's actually a constructor.  The properties
  //          of Object are stored in a "real" object elsewhere.

  console.log("Object.prototype:");
  console.log(Object.prototype);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: Object {}
  // Reason:  Following on from the previous example, prototype is the object
  //          containing all the members of the Object "class."  That's why
  //          this is an object, whereas Object itself is a function.
  //
  //          Still not sure why Function.prototype is a function and not an
  //          object, though...

  console.log("Object.constructor:");
  console.log(Object.constructor);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: function Function() { [native code] }
  // Reason:  As mentioned previously, all constructors are functions.

  console.log("Object.prototype.constructor:");
  console.log(Object.prototype.constructor);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: function Object() { [native code] }
  // Reason:  Here it gets a bit weird...normally an object's constructor
  //          and prototype.constructor resolve to the same thing...but for
  //          Object, that appears not to be the case!
  //
  //          This is due to the fact that Object, despite being top-level in
  //          JavaScript's object hierarchy, still needs to be invoked like a
  //          function when called as a constructor...and Function is a
  //          "subclass" of Object.
  //
  //          The relationship between Object and Function are strange indeed.

  console.log("Function instanceof Object:");
  console.log(Function instanceof Object);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: true
  // Reason:  This makes sense.  After all, everything is an instance of
  //          Object...

  console.log("Object instanceof Function:");
  console.log(Object instanceof Function);
  console.log('');
  // Outputs: true
  // Reason:  ...but this is a bit stranger!  How can Object and Function both
  //          be an instance of each other?!?
  //
  //          Again, it actually makes sense when you think about the
  //          prototype/constructor relationship.  Object itself is a
  //          constructor, and therefore a Function...but its prototype,
  //          Object.prototype, is a straight-up object and thus an instance
  //          of Object.

  // To conclude...
  // I hope this clarifies the interesting symbiotic relationship between
  // JavaScript's Object and Function "classes."  Again, if you want to truly
  // understand this, I cannot recommend this article enough...
