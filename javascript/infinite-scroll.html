<!--
  A pushState demonstration for users who exit your site and return via the
  back button.  It's possible to return them to the exact same position there
  were at before they left.  Very useful in long-scrolling vertical pages,
  such as those using infinite scrolling.

  NOTE:
  This file will NOT execute properly if loaded as a local file!
  If loaded via file:// the History API DOES NOT WORK.
  You must load this file via http://, even if it's on localhost.
